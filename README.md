# Mobile_Game_With_Threads-Handlers

A mobile game-GUESS4, developed to show my threads and handler manipulaltion skills. The explanation of the game is as follows:

Guess Four - is as an Android app. In this game,
each of two players sets up a secret sequence of four decimal digits, where each digit is not repeated. For
instance, 2017 is a legal sequence, but 2012 is not because the digit 2 is repeated. The two players take turns
guessing the sequence of digits of their opponent. Each guess consists of a 4 digit number, without repeated
digits. A player responds to an opponents guess by specifying the number of digits that were successfully
guessed in the correct position and the number of digits that were successfully guessed but in the wrong
positions. Thus, if a players chosen number is 2017 and the opponent guesses 1089, the opponent would be
told that one digit was guessed correctly in the correct position (i.e., the 0), and another digit was guessed in
the wrong position, (i.e., the 1). Guess Four has two background threads playing against
each other while also updating the user interface with their moves. The first thread to correctly guess the
opposing threadâ€™s number wins the game.

A simple modification of the game will shortly be launched on the playstore.
